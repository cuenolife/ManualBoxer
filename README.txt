/*
SORTER.AHK is ONLY for Login Functionality (NOT REQUIRED FOR CLIENT SWITCHING)

Read the source of ManualBoxer.ahk for the hotkeys, or read the popup messages that come on startup

RECOMMENDED: Change the loginR.png with your OWN image of the "R" in RuneScape login screen (this is my current way to check if a client is logged out / in. You can ALSO remove 
code blocks alluding to logging in

LN: 133-150 (Main Account Logins) <- These Lines can be deleted to REMOVE login functionality
LN: 108-134 <- These Lines can be deleted to REMOVE login functionality

1. Run ManualBoxer.AHK in it's own folder FIRST

2. Read the popups to know where to input data (you can skip inputting data if you DON'T want to utilize the login functionality of alts)

3. HOTKEYS are labled in the AHK file itself (ManualBoxer.ahk) but you can also read the popup

4. HOME key sets the CLIENT NAME that you are using (haven't tested RuneLite with names in title... So DISABLE the title containing your display name)

5. MUST use the HOME KEY to assign the clients EVERY TIME you open a new, or close an old one
